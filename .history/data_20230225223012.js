    desc: "One of the most overlooked perks of staying at The NASWA Resort in Laconia, New Hampshire, is our proximity to the White Mountain National Forest. Situated just outside the northernmost reaches of the central plateau, the White Mountains National Forest is home to a dense hardwood forest, sparkling waterways, seemingly endless outdoor recreational opportunities. As much as we gush about our guests finding plenty of entertaining on-site activities at The NASWA, we also encourage people to get out and explore New Hampshire and everything our beautiful state has to offer",
